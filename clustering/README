Original "scm*.arff" datasets from Ben Weber and Michael Matteas (UCSC)
They can be found here: http://eis.ucsc.edu/StarCraft_Data_Mining

If you want to label a .txt or an .arff, just to:
        python clustering.py *_X*.{txt|arff} [--serialize] [--plotR] [--plotM]
with X being the race to be analysed
If you want to annote an existing *_X*.txt file, you need to use clustering.py
with --serialize on it first and then:
        python annotate.py *_X*.txt -w
