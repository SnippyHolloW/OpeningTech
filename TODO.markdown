(See AIIDE 2011 submission: ) Try and move the model towards P(X|Obs) for late game, with a distance between Xes.

Use __absence__ of Observation(s) as an information. For instance: __if__ he did __not__ attack at time T1, __then__ he is __not__ doing these Openings so these other Openings are more likely to happen.

Use a *log-like* scale for time (instead of linear/uniform) that increases with the *divergence speed* (in the space of possible states/strategies) of StarCraft.
